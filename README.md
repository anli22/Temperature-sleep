# Overview
This repository contains the R code used for the main analysis presented in the article, "Climate warming may undermine sleep duration and quality in repeated-measure study of 23 million records."
# Acknowledgments
The code used here is heavily based on the code used for the analysis in the paper "Global warming may significantly increase childhood anemia burden in sub-Saharan Africa" by Yixiang Zhu, et al (One Earth, 2023). We downloaded their code from here: https://github.com/YixiangZhu/Anemia-temperature/ and then edited them as needed for our analysis.
